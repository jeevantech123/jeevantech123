## Hey there 👋

I am an aspiring software developer who is still in university.

Mostly a frontend developer for now, but as I get better at my work I plan on getting into backend and etc.

I also use adobe and other software such as canva to design and edit videos when I have extra freetime.

This is a profile where I will be uploading random projects, coding experiments, and anything else I feel like should be public. Everything here is built by myself, without any AI generation or copy pasting.

## Tools, Tech, and Skills

● All Microsoft and Adobe projects

● Prominent in using IDEs, especially IntelliJ

● Good desktop computer and internet access

● Skilled in basic Java and Python, little bit of C++ and x86-64 assembly
